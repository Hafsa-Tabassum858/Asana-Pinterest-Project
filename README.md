# Asana-Pinterest Project 🚀

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a structured content operations and performance monitoring system. It integrates workflow management in Asana with KPI-driven analytics in Google Sheets to enable execution visibility, structured reporting, and data-driven decision-making.

The system was built to simulate real-world project governance and performance tracking processes.
